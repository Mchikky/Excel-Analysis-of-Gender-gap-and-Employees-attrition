- Gender gap of 12% with higher number of men across roles.
- Attrition rate of 49% (male 28% and female 21%).
- Interns earn the highest salary.
- Tenure and performance do not affect salaries.
- Training hours do not affect performance in some cases.
  
## Recomendations
- Close gender gap and encourage more women to step into managerial roles.
- With an attrition rate of 49%, staff needs more motivation such as pay rise and bonus.
- Review salary of interns downwards across all departments.
- Translate tenure and performance into salary increment to retain staff.
  
## Limitations
- There is no background narrative to the data such as the type of company
- The tenure variable does not have any unit of time whether in days, months, or years
- Salary does not have any currency so we used Naira (#)
